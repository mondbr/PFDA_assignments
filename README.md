# Programming for Data Analytics 

by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for the the practical assignments for the Programming for Data Analytics module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in the winter semester of 2024/25.

It contains solutions for the PFDA (Programming for Data Analysis) course assignments. Each assignment focuses on different data analysis tasks using Python, including weather data analysis, pie charts, and risk simulations.


## Learning Outcomes of this Module:
- Programmatically generate plots and other visual representations from data.
- Design algorithms to solve numerical problems through coding.
- Develop software that integrates and utilizes standard numerical libraries.
- Select and implement appropriate data structures for data-intensive programming tasks.

## Get Started

To begin, you need Python installed on your machine. To do that, you can use the following: 

**Anaconda** \
[Download](https://www.anaconda.com/download) \
The easiest way to install Python and the necessary packages for this course.

**Visual Studio Code** \
[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com) \
The editor I will use to create Python scripts. 

**Git** \
[Download](https://git-scm.com) \
The software I will use to track my progress.


## Assignments:

- [Assignment 2](https://github.com/mondbr/PFDA_assignments/blob/main/assignment2-weather.ipynb) - **Weather**: Analyzes weather data and visualizes trends.
- [Assignment 3](https://github.com/mondbr/PFDA_assignments/blob/main/assignment3-pie.ipynb) - **Pie**: Generates pie charts to represent distribution of the email domains
- [Assignment 5](https://github.com/mondbr/PFDA_assignments/blob/main/assignment5_risk.ipynb) - **Risk**: Simulates battles in the *Risk game*, tracking losses and  army sizes.
- [Assignment 6](https://github.com/mondbr/PFDA_assignments/blob/main/assignment6_Weather.ipynb) - **Weather**: Advanced weather data analysis with visualizations.
